# python-challenge

Additional information:

I used the corrected class exercises and slides as well as different internet sources to help me structure my codes.

I do find a different outcome on the very first exercise (PyBank folder) however it seems that my code is correct and running throught the correct datas and did not find from where the issue was comming from.
